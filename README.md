# Certificate Approval System

A streamlined application for managing, tracking, and approving digital certificates within an organization.

## Overview

The Certificate Approval System provides a centralized platform for handling the certificate lifecycle, from request submission to approval, issuance, and renewal. This system helps organizations maintain security standards while simplifying the administrative overhead of certificate management.

## Features

- **Certificate Request Management**: Submit and track certificate requests through a user-friendly interface
- **Approval Workflows**: Configurable multi-level approval processes based on certificate type and organizational policies
- **Certificate Inventory**: Comprehensive tracking of all certificates with detailed metadata
- **Notification System**: Automated alerts for pending approvals, expirations, and renewal deadlines
- **Audit Logging**: Complete history of certificate-related activities for compliance and security reporting
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for requesters, approvers, and administrators
- **Integration Capabilities**: API support for connecting with PKI systems, identity providers, and other security tools

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- MongoDB 5.0+
- Redis (for caching and session management)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/certificate-approval-system.git
cd certificate-approval-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration details
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash

## Configuration

The system can be configured through the `.env` file and additional configuration files in the `config/` directory. Key configuration options include:

- Database connection parameters
- Authentication providers
- Email notification settings
- Certificate templates
- Approval workflow definitions

## Usage

### Basic Usage Flow

1. **Request Submission**: Users submit certificate requests through the web interface or API
2. **Approval Process**: Designated approvers review and approve/reject requests based on organizational policies
3. **Certificate Issuance**: Upon approval, certificates are issued automatically or through integration with PKI systems
4. **Certificate Management**: Ongoing monitoring and management of issued certificates

### API Reference

API documentation is available at `/api/docs` once the application is running.

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authentication uses industry standard protocols (OAuth 2.0, SAML, etc.)
- Regular security audits are recommended to maintain system integrity
- Certificate private keys are securely stored and protected
